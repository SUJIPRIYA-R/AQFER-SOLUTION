In this solution i had used Brute-Force method.
consider all subarrays and calculate the sum of their elements. 
If the sum of the subarray is equal to the given sum, print it. 

This approach takes O(n3) time as the subarray sum is calculated in O(1) time for each of n2 subarrays of an array of size n, 
and it takes O(n) time to print a subarray.
-------------
I had used JAVA language.
------------
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5} , sum = 12
Output should be {2,3,7}
-------
sample output is attached..
