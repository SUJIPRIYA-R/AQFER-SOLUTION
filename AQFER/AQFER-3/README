Create  a Distinct Digit Array.
It has two nested loops. 
The outer loop picks an element one by one starting from the leftmost element. 
The inner loop checks if the element is present on left side of it. 
If present, then ignores the element, else prints the element. 
----------------
input = A = [2,2,4,2,3,4, 3,7]
Count of 2 is 3, count of 3 & 4 is 2 and count of 7 is 1.
As the count of 3 and 4 is the same but 4 has come in first in A, the order has to be preserved. So
output should be [2,4,3,7]

sample output is attached..
